# 10.1
When $N=2$, the height of binary tree is $1$

# 10.2
(result in python heapq)
1. [5]
2. [5, 6]
3. [6, 5]
4. [5, 6, 1]
   
# 10.3
(result in python heapq)
[1,2,3,5,7,5,4]

# 10.4
Since Strongly blanced binary tree(SBBT)'s height is added when $N$ exceeded $2^a$, where $a$ is natural number, $h$ is approximated by $\log_2(N)$. Hence, $h = O(\log(N))$. 

# 10.5
Since Tree is connected, $N$ vertex tree has at least $N-1$ edges.
Moreover, Tree doesn't have cycle, Tree can't have more than $N-1$ edges because it $N$ edges and vertex would make cycle.
Hence, $N$ vertex Tree has $N-1$ edges.
