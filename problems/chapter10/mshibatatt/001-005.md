Since Strongly blanced binary tree(SBBT)'s height is added when $2^h$ vertex are added.
$
1 + 2^1 + \dots + 2^{h-1} \le N \Leftrightarrow 2^h \le N +1
$
$h$ is approximated by $\log_2(N+1)$. Hence, $h$ is $O(\log(N))$.

Since Tree is connected, $N$ vertex tree has at least $N-1$ edges.
Moreover, Tree doesn't have cycle, Tree can't have more than $N-1$ edges because it $N$ edges and vertex would make cycle.
Hence, $N$ vertex Tree has $N-1$ edges.
