## Problem.
Show Hamiltonian Cycle Problem(HCP) is in class NP
## Answer.
If one has a proper hint of path, one can check if the hint is a hamiltonian cycle in at most $O(|V|)$, which shows HCP is in class poly check. Hence, HCP is in class NP.

1. Scanning path and rasie a flag if it has passed each node. $O(|V|)$
    - Return False if it passes a node twice.
    - Return False if start and goal are different.
2. Return False if a node has not passed. $O(|V|)$
    - Otherwise return True.

## Problem.
Show Clique Problem is in class NP
## Answer.
If one has a proper hint of complete graph, one can check if $G$ includes complete graph in at most $O(k^2)$. Note that $k \le |V|$. Hence, Clique Problem is in class poly check, so in class NP.

1. Check if $G$ includes the hint. $O(k^2)$
2. Check if the hint doesn't have self loop or multiple graph. $O(k^2)$
3. Check if all nodes in the hint are connected. $O(k^2)$
