## Problem.
Formulate maximum stable set problem on undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ as an integer programming problem.
## Answer.
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \max_{x_i} && \sum_{i \in V} x_i \\
& s.t. && \forall\ i \in V, \ x_i \in \{0, 1\} \\
& && \forall\ e \in E, \ \sum_{i \in e} x_i \leq 1 
\end{aligned}

## Problem.
Show that First Fit greedy algorithm is 2-approximation algorithm for a bin packing problem.
## Answer.
Let the answer of First Fit method be $V_{FF}$ and optimal answer be $V_{opt}$. By definition of a First Fit algorithm, $V_{FF} - 1$ bins are filled more than half of the full. Hence, $ 2 V_{opt} > V_{FF} - 1$, which results that $ 2 V_{opt} \ge V_{FF}$ because both of the $V_{opt}$ and $V_{FF}$ are interger.
